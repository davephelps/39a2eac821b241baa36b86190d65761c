# Application Configuration

In this lab we will explore how to reference configuration values from our local settings, rather than hard coding them directly into the workflow.

## Add Configurtion for the HTTP Action

For the *Check Customer Exists* action, we have hard coded the URL and the subscription key directly into the workflow. To add these to our local configuration, edit the *local.settings.json* file from your project, and add the two values, as below:

-    "url" : "url provided by trainer",
-    "url_key" : "key provider by trainer"

The *local.settings.json* file should be as follows:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
    "APP_KIND": "workflowapp",
    "WORKFLOWS_SUBSCRIPTION_ID": "",
    "url" : "your url",
    "url_key" : "your key"
  }
}
```
Now we have added the configuration values to our local settings, we can reference them from the HTTP action in the workflow. To do this, navigate to the *Check_Customer_Exists* action and remove the existing url up to where the shows /email, then click the expression icon, and enter *appsetting('url')* and click *Add*.

We need to do the same thing with the api key, but using *appsetting('url_key')* instead. The action should look as follows:

![App Setting](<images/workflow - appsetting.png>)

Test the workflow to validate the values are being retrieved correctly from *local.settings.json*.
